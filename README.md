### the question of improper integral of KNN was from bishop 2.61:â€Œ
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3179785/how-to-show-the-k-nearest-neighbor-density-model-is-an-improper-distribution-bi


## other questions was from DHS(R.O. Duda, P.E. Hart, D.G. Stork. Pattern Classification. Second edition. John Wiley and Sons, 2000.)[aka duda]:
after much reaserch found about it from (https://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs2750-Spring03/) after massively refered by everyone just DHS:
